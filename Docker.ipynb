    "\n",
    "**Docker** is a software container platform. It is a tool designed to ease deployment and run applications using containers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Docker Images** are blueprints of our applications. Basically, they are read-only templates composed of layered filesystems with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization. **Docker Hub** is a registry of Docker Images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Docker Containers** are isolated and secured shipping containers that created from Docker images and are real instances of our application. They allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. \n",

    "## Benefits of Docker\n",
    "#### Build App Only Once\n",
    "An application inside a container can run on any system that as Docker installed. So there is no need to build and configure app multiple times on different platforms.\n",
    "<img src='docker1.png' alt='docker1' width=600 height=600>\n",
    "#### Portability\n",
    "Docker containers can run on any platform. It can run on our local system, Amazon EC2, Google Cloud Platform, VirtualBox, etc.\n",
    "#### Identical Environment\n",
    "Docker allows us to test our application inside a container and ship it inside a container. This means the environment in which we test is identical to the one on which the app will run in production.\n",
    "#### Version Control\n",
    "Like GIT, Docker has in-built version control system. Docker containers works just like GIT repositories, allowing us to commit changes to our Docker images and version control them.\n",
    "#### Isolation\n",
    "With Docker, every application works in isolation in its own container and does not interferes with other applications running on the same system. So multiple containers can run on the same system without interference. For removal also, we can simply delete the container and it will not leave behind any files or traces on the system.\n",
    "<img src='docker2.png' alt='docker2' width=600 height=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Productivity\n",
    "Docker allows faster and more efficient deployments without worrying about running our app on different platforms. It increases productivity many folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtualization vs Containerization\n",
    "* Containers are light-weight alternative to virtual machines (VMs), no extra copy of OS required, hence smaller in size.\n",
    "* In virtual machines, resource allocation is fixed and does not change as per application needs.\n",
    "<img src='docker4.png' alt='docker4' width=600 height=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "Docker has a client-server architecture.\n",
    "* The **command line interface (CLI)** is the Docker client\n",
    "* The **Docker Daemon** (or **Docker Server**) has all the containers\n",
    "* Docker Server recieves commands from the Docker client through CLI or REST APIs and manages Docker objects such as  images, containers, networks and volumes\n",
    "* Docker client and daemon can be present on the same host (machine) or different hosts.\n",
    "* All the components of Docker client and server together forms the **Docker Engine**.\n",
